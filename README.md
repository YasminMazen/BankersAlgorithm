# Banker's Algorithm 

This is a C# Windows Forms application that implements the Banker's Algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. The application allows users to input resource allocation and maximum resource requirement tables and performs the necessary calculations to determine if a safe sequence of processes exists.

Usage:

Enter the number of rows and columns for the resource allocation and maximum resource requirement tables in Form1.
Click the "Generate Tables" button to create the tables based on the specified dimensions.
Fill in the values for each cell in the generated tables.
Click the "Next" button in Form1 to proceed to Form2.
Enter the available resources in the text box provided in Form2.
Click the "Check Safe Sequence" button to determine if a safe sequence exists. The result will be displayed in a label.
Click the "Next" button in Form2 to proceed to Form3.
Enter the process number, requested resources, and click the "Request Resources" button in Form3 to make a resource request.
The system will check if the request can be granted without causing a deadlock. A success or error message will be displayed accordingly.
Forms Overview:

Form1:

Allows users to input the resource allocation and maximum resource requirement tables.
Contains text boxes for specifying the number of rows and columns in the tables.
Generates the tables based on user input.
Displays the generated tables in separate DataGridViews.
Proceeds to the next form.

Form2:

Displays the result of subtracting the resource allocation table from the maximum resource requirement table.
Calculates the need matrix.
Provides a text box for users to input the available resources.
Checks for a safe sequence using the Banker's Algorithm.
Displays the result of the safety check.
Proceeds to the next form.

Form3:

Allows users to request additional resources for a specific process.
Prompts the user to enter the process number and requested resources.
Updates the allocation and available matrices based on the request.
Performs a safety check using the Banker's Algorithm to determine if the system remains in a safe state.
Displays a success or error message based on the result of the safety check.

Technologies Used:

C#
Windows Forms
This application provides a practical implementation of the Banker's Algorithm and allows users to visualize the resource allocation process and determine the system's safety.
